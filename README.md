Here I have taken the MNIST Dataset from keras library that has 60,000 28*28 handwritten images as training data and 10,000 handwritten images as testing data. I have preprocessed the image data to make it ready for deep learning / Machine learning model. I have done a convoluted neural network model also did support vector classifier and K-Nearest_Neighbor classifier to predict the digits. We will compare all the model's performance in this project
